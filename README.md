# Lighter Data Analysis üïØÔ∏è

gLighter! As Lighter emerges as one of the notable platforms in the ongoing **‚ÄúPerpDEX Summer‚Äù** within the crypto space, I aim to analyze trends in its key protocol metrics to better understand its performance and growth trajectory over time. Such analysis can offer deeper insights into Lighter‚Äôs potential valuation ahead of its TGE, and subsequently provide meaningful comparisons against other DEXs and CEXs offering similar perpetual trading features.

## Protocol Information

Lighter is a decentralized trading platform focused on delivering unmatched security and scalability. It features verifiable matching and liquidations, operating with performance comparable to leading traditional exchanges.

## Overview

A Python project built for reliable and extensible interaction with both **zkLighter** and the **Alchemy** API. It supports end-to-end retrieval, analysis, and visualization of cryptocurrency market data - including candlesticks, volume, funding rates, open interest, and other key metrics - alongside on-chain EVM analytics for protocol valuation, asset flow tracking, and detailed wallet or user segmentation.

Key findings includes:
- Retrieving account and market data from zkLighter API
- Analyzing candlestick data across multiple markets
- Tracking and visualizing perpetuals trading volume
- Tracking and visualizing funding rates
- Monitoring current open interest
- Evaluating Lighter Liquidity Provider (LLP) performance
- Retrieving EVM node data from provider Alchemy API
- Parsing EVM block data (transfers and logs) to analyze asset flows and total value locked (TVL)
- Assessing deposit and withdrawal activity, profiling user wallet behavior, and segmenting wallets by size and activity

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd lighter-analysis
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
MY_L1_ADDRESS=your_ethereum_address_here
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key_here
```

## Features & Data Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive suite of tools for cryptocurrency market and on-chain protocol analysis, organized into interactive Jupyter notebooks:

- **Market Data Analysis (`lighter.ipynb`):**
  - **Volume Analysis:**  
    - Visualize trading volumes across all markets
    - Identify top 5 markets by volume
    - Analyze historical volume trends and total market volume over time
  - **Funding Rate Analysis:**  
    - Track funding rates with heatmap visualizations
    - Explore historical funding rate trends
    - Calculate direction-aware funding (long/short)
  - **Open Interest Tracking:**  
    - Monitor current open interest by market
    - Correlate trading activity with open interest
    - Highlight top markets by open interest (OI)
  - **LLP (Lighter Liquidity Provider) Performance:**  
    - Track Total Value Locked (TVL)
    - Calculate Annual Percentage Yield (APY)
    - Analyze share price history and daily returns

- **On-Chain Analytics (`evm.ipynb`):**
  - **Total Value Locked (TVL) Analysis:**  
    - Monitor contract balances
    - Analyze deposits and withdrawals
    - Visualize daily, weekly, and monthly asset flows
  - **User Wallet Segmentation:**  
    - Parse transaction logs for unique wallet deposit activity
    - Segment user profiles by deposit size and frequency
    - Group users based on activity and wallet characteristics

Both notebooks leverage robust data processing and visualization to deliver actionable insights into protocol health, user behavior, and market dynamics.
